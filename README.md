## by Princess Obazee


## Dataset

>The data was gathered from disparate sources in different formats. The sources are the WeRateDogs Twitter Archive file that was given to Udacity by WeRateDogs which was stored as a csv (comma-separated values) file. The data contained the names of the dogs, timestamp of tweets, dog ratings etc. Another source was the image prediction file hosted on Udacity's servers in a tsv
(tab-separated values) file that was downloaded using the requests library. The file contained the name of the predicted images and their confidence levels. The third source was Twitter's API to query additional data on the tweet's id, favorite count and retweet count.
